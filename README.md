# C++ Codes

## Learn C++ from :

1. [programmiz](https://www.programiz.com/cpp-programming)
2. [freecodecamp_youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLnPwxZdW4Y&t)

I'm using Ubuntu to run this C++ programs.

In the C++ folder you can find basic code for C++. In array folder you can find some programs using array. In basic_project folder you can find basic example projects.

## Some IDE where you can run this programs are:

1. Install [DEV-C++](https://sourceforge.net/projects/orwelldevcpp/)
2. You can use online compiler [Online_Compiler](https://www.programiz.com/cpp-programming/online-compiler/)

### C++ is very close to C but it is the bigger brother of C.

***BASIC*** :
In C++ it uses cout and cin for input and output. cout is used to print whatever you like. cin takes the user input.

                                  ___________              _____
                                 |           |            |     |
                                 |           |            |     |
                                  ___________             |     |
                                       |                  |     |
                                      ___                  _____

For ***cout*** it uses ***<<*** two less than sign you can easily remember this by your screen is at the left and your CPU is at the right the CPU is giving out and output.

For ***cin*** is uses ***>>*** two greater than sign you can easliy remember this by your CPU is at the right and your Screen is at the left the CPU is getting and input.

```

It will make a new file name as any_program_name
```
./any_program_name
```
