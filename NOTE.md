vector<int> v1;

Qt for GUI
ACE for distributed programming

cout - character output stream
return 0;
0 indicates that the program has terminated successfully

The program that links such parts together is called a linker

C++ source code : hello_world.cpp -> C++ compiler -> Object code : hello_world.obj -> Linker -> Executable program : hello_world.exe
                                                                                        ^
                                                                                        |
                                                                Object code form the C++ standard library: ostream.obj

Types of error :
- Compile time error : Errors found by the compiler
- Link-time error : Errors found by the linker
- Run-time error or logic error : Errors not found until the program is run

cin - character input
